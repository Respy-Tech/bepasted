# BePasted Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to a community that respects the privacy and security of all participants.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Respecting the privacy and security goals of the project
* Supporting the no-login, log-free philosophy of the service

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Attempting to circumvent the service's security measures or privacy protections
* Using BePasted to distribute harmful, illegal, or malicious content
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject content that does not align with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor or user for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the BePasted service itself, and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at contact@bepasted.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Privacy Commitment

Given BePasted's emphasis on privacy and security:

* We will protect user privacy by minimizing data collection and anonymizing necessary operational data
* We implement only the minimal logging required for security, abuse prevention, and service reliability
* We anonymize all IP addresses and avoid collecting personally identifiable information
* All data collection practices will be transparently documented
* All features must maintain our core values of privacy, simplicity, and security
* Data retention periods will be limited and clearly defined
* We respect users' right to share content without unnecessary restrictions while maintaining reasonable abuse prevention
