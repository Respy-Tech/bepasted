              <h1>Information automatically collected</h1>
              <p>BePasted collects a minimal amount of information to ensure service functionality and prevent abuse. Here's what we collect and how we handle it:</p>
              
              <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
              <p>For essential service functionality and abuse prevention, we process IP addresses as follows:</p>

                <li><strong>Limited Retention:</strong> IP address data is automatically deleted after the configured retention period (default: 30 days)</li>
                <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not use IP addresses for tracking users across sessions or sites</li>
                <li><strong>No Commercial Use:</strong> We never sell, trade, or monetize IP address data</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h2>Technical Data</h2>
              <p>Some browser and device information is automatically collected when you visit our platform. This information is used solely for ensuring service functionality and does not reveal your specific identity. It includes:</p>

              </ul>
              <p>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our platform, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
              
              <h2>Paste Data</h2>
              <p>The content you submit to BePasted is stored in our database with the following privacy considerations:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Public pastes are visible to anyone with the link</li>
                <li>Private pastes require a password and are encrypted</li>
                <li>Pastes expire according to your selected settings (time or view count)</li>
                <li>Expired pastes are archived for 3 months and then permanently deleted</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
              <p>We use the following third-party services with privacy considerations:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>SimpleAnalytics:</strong> A privacy-focused analytics service that does not track individual users or collect personal data</li>
                <li><strong>Cloudflare Turnstile:</strong> Used for bot detection and prevention with privacy protections.

              <p>We have specific retention policies for different types of data:</p>

            <h1>Sale of Business</h1>
            <p>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of BePasted or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that portion of BePasted or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                Corporate Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under
                common control with BePasted, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you

                terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h1>Governing Law</h1>

                  You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in connection with any action or dispute arising between
                  the parties under or in connection with this Privacy Policy except for those individuals who may have rights to
                  make claims under Privacy Shield, or the Swiss-US framework.</p>
                <p>The laws of Malaysia, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Agreement and your use of
                  the website. Your use of the website may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international
                  laws.</p>
                <p>By using
                  BePasted or contacting us directly, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do
                  not agree to this Privacy Policy, you should not engage with our website, or use our services. Continued use of

                </p>

                <h1>Your Consent</h1>
                <p>We've updated our Privacy Policy to provide you with complete transparency into what is being set when you visit
                  our site and how it's being used. By using our website, you hereby
                  consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.
                </p>

                <h1>Links to Other Websites</h1>
                <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated
                  or controlled by
                  BePasted. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed in such websites,
                  and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by us. Please remember
                  that when you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.
                  Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our platform, is subject
                  to that website's own rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own cookies or other methods to collect
                  information about you.
                </p>
                <h1>Cookies</h1>
                <p>
                  BePasted uses minimal cookies for essential functionality. These are primarily for CSRF protection and security purposes. We do not use cookies for tracking, analytics, or advertising purposes. SimpleAnalytics, our privacy-focused analytics service, operates without cookies. Any non-essential functionality that would typically require cookies has been designed to work without them to maximize your privacy.
                </p>

                <h1>Blocking and disabling cookies and similar technologies</h1>
                <p>You can set your browser to block cookies if you prefer, but this may affect some essential functionality of our service. Most browsers allow you to control cookie settings, typically found in the "Settings," "Preferences," or "Privacy" sections.</p>
                <h1>Kids' Privacy</h1>
                <p>We do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
                  from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us
                  with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under
                  the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.
                </p>
                <h1>Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to this Privacy Policy so that they
                  accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example,
                  through our Service) before we make changes to this Privacy Policy and give you an opportunity to review them
                  before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Privacy
                  Policy. If you do not want to agree to this or any updated Privacy Policy, you can delete your account.</p>

                <h1>Third-Party Services</h1>
                <p>We may display, include or make available third-party content (including data, information, applications and
                  other products services) or provide links to third-party websites or services ("Third- Party Services").</p>
                <p>You acknowledge and agree that
                  BePasted shall not be responsible for any Third-Party Services, including their accuracy,
                  completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect thereof.
                  BePasted does not assume and shall not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other
                  person or entity for any Third-Party Services.
                </p>
                <p>Third-Party Services and links thereto are provided solely as a convenience to you and you access and use them
                  entirely at your own risk and subject to such third parties' terms and conditions.</p>
                <h1>Tracking Technologies</h1>
                <ul><br><li>Local Storage
                <br><br>
                <p>Local Storage sometimes known as DOM storage, provides web apps with methods and protocols for storing client-side data. Web storage supports persistent data storage, similar to cookies but with a greatly enhanced capacity and no information stored in the HTTP request header.</p></li><br><li>Sessions
                   <br><br>
                   <p>We use "Sessions" to identify the areas of our website that you have visited. A Session is a small piece of data stored on your computer or mobile device by your web browser.</p></li><br>
                <li>Website Analytics
                <br><br>
                <p>We use SimpleAnalytics, a privacy-focused analytics service, to understand visitor behavior on our website. SimpleAnalytics is fundamentally different from traditional analytics platforms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SimpleAnalytics does <strong>not</strong> use cookies</li>
                    <li>SimpleAnalytics does <strong>not</strong> collect or store personal data</li>
                    <li>SimpleAnalytics does <strong>not</strong> track IP addresses</li>
                    <li>SimpleAnalytics does <strong>not</strong> create user profiles or fingerprints</li>
                    <li>SimpleAnalytics does <strong>not</strong> sell your data to third parties</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The data collected includes only non-personal information like page views, referrer information (the website you came from), browser information, device type, and country-level location data (never precise locations). None of this data can identify you personally.</p>
                <p>This approach means we do not need to show cookie consent banners, as SimpleAnalytics is fully compliant with privacy regulations including GDPR, PECR, and CCPA by design.</p>
                <p>We respect "Do Not Track" browser settings. If you have this enabled, SimpleAnalytics will not collect any data from your visit.</p>
                </li><br>
            </ul>
            <h1>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>
            <p>We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>

            <h1>What is GDPR?</h1>
            <p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>
            <p>The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers' data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p>

            <h1>What is personal data?</h1>
            <p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person's name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>
            <p>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
            <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
            <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
            <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Why is GDPR important?</h1>
            <p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At BePasted we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p>

            <h1>Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h1>
            <p>We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. BePasted processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We store your data only for the duration specified in our Data Retention policies (configurable, defaults: maximum 30 days for active pastes and 90 days for archived pastes).</p>
            <p>If you need to exercise your rights under GDPR to access, update, retrieve or remove data, please contact us through the contact information provided at the end of this policy.</p>
